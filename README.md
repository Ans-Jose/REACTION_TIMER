#  Reaction Timer Project  

This is a **Reaction Timer** project that measures how fast a person can respond to a signal.  
Itâ€™s a fun project to test **reflex speed** using simple electronics and microcontroller programming.  

##  Features
- Measures reaction time in milliseconds.  
- Shows results on an LED / LCD / Serial Monitor.  
- Random delay before signal (to avoid guessing).  
- Easy to build and test with friends.  

##  Components Used
- Arduino / Microcontroller  
- Push Button  
- LED (for signal)  
- Resistors, Jumper Wires, Breadboard  
- (Optional) LCD Display or Serial Monitor  

##  How It Works
1. The system waits for a **random time**.  
2. The **LED turns ON** (or buzzer sounds) as the signal.  
3. The player must press the **button** as fast as possible.  
4. Arduino measures the time between signal and button press.  
5. The result (reaction time) is displayed.  

##  Applications
- Fun game to test reflexes with friends.  
- Useful in psychology/physiology experiments.  
- Can be extended into sports training tools.
